# CODESIGN: Mixed Reality as Pariticipatory Design Tool
## Design Democracy through Spatialized negotiation
In 1969, Arnstein defined public participation as "the inalienable right of citizens"and proposed the Ladder of Citizen Participation. In architecture, as urbanrenewal and community transformation gained momentum, "participatorydesign" emerged as a core principle for spatial renovation. However, constrainedby professional barriers and interactive limitations, designers and clients couldonly exchange ideas through verbal communication or 2D drawings, withdesigners modifying and feedbacking later-a process that severely underminedinteraction efficiency and experience.
This project focuses on the core pursuit of "genuine participation" in participatorydesign, leveraging MR technology to build a real-time collaborative design tool. ltenables designers and clients to overlay virtual design spaces onto physical sitesfacilitating synchronous interaction, dynamic feedback, and instant designgeneration. By breaking the limitations of "token participation," it establishes a'cooperative" design model for equal dialogue.
## Structure
- Grasshopper for Action 1-4 Behavior computing
- Grasshopper's behavior computing plugin
- Summarize the behavior calculation and collaborative design workflow of the four basic actions, and carry out overall lightweight processing
